I have been sharing my learnings and experiments with getting Fit.

5 July 2023
1. Upper back is getting tensed, while doing cable push down. 
2. Found a good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=vZ02QXFuWFc&ab_channel=VicsnaturalWorkoutandFitnessChannel) to do the excercise. 
Ideas
1. Will Add more information about what's week like in the Twitter posts 
2. Will shrink the Updates to 1 line and add more about what I felt.
