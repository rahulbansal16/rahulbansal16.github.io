Story of Hungry and Thirsty Donkey

There was a thirsty and hungry Donkey.
To his right side, there was grass,
And water on his left.

He will look at the grass, 
and then look at the water.
Thinking whether to drink water or
eat grass. 

He kept doing that,
and died of both hunger and thirst.
We behave similarly in life.
We would want to learn all hard things simultaneously.

We want to learn data science, 
competitive programming, 
and ethical hacking...

All at the same time.

If we zoom out from the situation.
It's possible to learn one for some time,
and move on to the next after that.

Have you faced such situation before?
