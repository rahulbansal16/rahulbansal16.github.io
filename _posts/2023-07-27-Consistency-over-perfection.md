summary: "Consistency, over Perfection"
---

Back in 2016, I enrolled in a local GYM.
I met a guy, doing some excercises in wrong form.

Fast Forward to year 2021, I went to the same GYM.
He looked very ripped, muscular and strong.

We tend overthink perfection over consistency.
The forces of consistency can beat the imperfection over any long run.

You will never find a person who does perfect form of exercise, if he is not consistent
to be big or muscual.
You will find lots of people in your GYM who are consistent with not perfect form to be very muscular.

This is the same force that you with big companies, having lots of user complaints grow over time
because of consistent efforts.
