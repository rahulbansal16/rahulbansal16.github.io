What's my Why?
[Draft]
I have been thinking about, What will I consider the my Life as success.
I don't want to do things, just for the sake of doing them.
I want to provide positive experience to everyone.
If someone applies to the Job and gets rejected.
I will make sure that I am giving them proper reasoning.
My Emails that I write will not be boring.

What kind of problems do you want to solve in life?
One topic that I am deeply passionate about is
How to build knowledge graphs to gain deeper understanding of things.
Is there a way to learn the way Elon Musk Learns about a topic.

If I can build a powerful automation tool that can run any language.
Like reading from the system, files etc.

What I am missing?
