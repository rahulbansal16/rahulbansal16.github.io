Most of the Networking Events sucks ..

Early, In my career. I was very active in meetups. I would travel to the other side of Banglore to join meetups.

I meet a lot of people. We will exchange numbers, and will never message again. It was a recurring theme for some time.

Till I realized a better way to network. It's never to network. Instead, spend time doing. 

Want to connect with open-source contributors? Start contributing to open-source projects. You will connect with lots of devs over time.
Want to connect with builders? Go and take part in hackathons.

The connection made this way will be strong and will last longer.

I share my weekly learnings. Follow for more.

Most of the Networking Events.


Early, In my carrer. I was very active in meetups. I would travel to other side of Banglore to join meetups.

I meet lot of people this way. We will exchange socials, whatsApps never to message each other. 

When I was early in my carrer, I used to go to meetups in Banglore. I will meet people who 
will talk about new ideas and I was impressed by them.

Next time I will go to meetup and will bump into the same person and he will tell me about 
What needs to be done. He would tell me about some other new thing and the old thing that he necer executed.

Slowly I started realizing, it's all blabber not real substabce. 
Later, I realized that the best way is to do build/create what you like and put it out.

You want to meet good open source contributors. Start contributing to open source projects.
You want to meet hikers, start going to hiking.
You want to network with Fitness enthusist, start going to fitness classes.

The people you will meet this way, will be more biased towards actions.
In the end, I will end it using the Peter Theil Quote.
Spend you 20s working on something you genuinely align your interest with. -->
