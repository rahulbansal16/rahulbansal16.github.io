### Rough Draft

I have been building products from my college days back in 2012, but I became serious about them in October 2020. When I quit my job at Microsoft to build products.

I started going through the Startup School learnings and started implementing them in my products but I did not get much things.

Yesterday, I learned something important which was missing. I have been focusing on building things and killing them on my own. I am not focusing on taking the same products to more people. 

What are some of my inhibitions that is stopping me? I am not able to fully unlink the product and market. I am not killing my products very often. If there is something that is not working. I should stay with the product more often.

What I am missing?   
1. I am not focusing on a niche with an idea. I could have tried various channels and tried posting them to various channels till I have exhausted everything.

2. I get distracted too early for new ideas. I have lots of half baked ideas and I keep on getting distraced with new ones.

3. I am bundling everything in one extension which is not an ideal way as it becomes hard to explain the idea.

4. Sometimes I feel blocked by a technical challenge and unable to figure out a way around it.

5. Unlike my weight loss journey. I don't have rough outline for my startup. I hit a roadblock and the idea becomes dormant for sometime.

What is the way forward?  
1. For all the idea spent 1 week, posting the idea on various channels.
2. Create basic landing page and SEO stuff and let it run in auto pilot mode.
3. If you are not getting any users, let the idea die othwerwise improve the product based on the feedback.

Action Items
1. Start Posting your weekly goals on the Twitter and share progress
