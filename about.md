Hi, I am Rahul ðŸ‘‹. This is my personal space for sharing my thoughts, learnings and failures. I enjoy solving problems using technology and making sustainable business out of it.

### Values
Over the course of my career. I have formed a value system that I strive for and people I want to work with. I want to make a company on these principles.
- **Be Kind**
    Everyone is fighting their own battle. The least you can do is to be kind to them.

- **No Ego**
    Ego is a zero-sum game, I don't want to play that game in which you cannot expand the cake.

- **High Trust**
    Good things happen when people trust each other.

- **Bias For Action**
    There should be high bias for action. I am firm believer that you can not brainstorm for the best idea or decision. It requires work to make each decision right.

- **Growth Mindset**
    Learn from your mistake and grow.

- **Disagree and Commit**
    You can't agree on everything, but you can commit to thing and let it take it's course.
