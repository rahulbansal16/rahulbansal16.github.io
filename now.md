I quit my job to build a sustainable business. I am trying my hands at indiehacking. I am building products launching them and try to understand what works and what does not.

So far I have got some success. I have made 25K INR doing indiehacking. Built close to 6 products over the timeperiod.

### Experiments
* Getting Fit in public. I am sharing about my weekly progress in public for fat loss.
* Creating an Audience. I am writing weekly posts on Linkedin to improve my writing and build audience.
