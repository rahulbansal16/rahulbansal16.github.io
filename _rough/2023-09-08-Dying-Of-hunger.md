If a person is dying of blood loss and time is going out.
You don't want the person to get treated for cough or other things.

Same rule applies to your life and projects.
You are going to treat

You are building your project and have not figured out what customers want.
There is no point in making the UI look more attractive.
Adding Favicon to website etc.

Being a developer when things are risky there is a strong urge to.
overoptimise products specially in a fast moving scenario.

The reality is the feature is not going to exist next week.
But you will need your motivation to stay so 

Specially if you are from DSA background there is something in you to write optimised code.
