Have you ever went to a shop
and purchased a product

And at the counter
hastily took your wallet
And put your hand in the wallet

Whatever notes were fusted in your pocked
You gave to the owner.

Off course not,
You count them so that you are getting promised,

But I will often see people hastily emptying there precious 
time frivolous time over stupid arguments without thinking about the value 
they are getting from them.

They will keep on munching on random items without thinking
Is the calories provided by it is same or not.

Let's start counting, if you are interested to progress.

Obvioulsy not asking you to put a tag on every interaction with the outside world.
But be mindful that you are not just using the fist full of money to empty it.
