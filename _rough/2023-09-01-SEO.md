2. Use tool like SiteBulbs To check for issues.
3. Don't redirect URLs to trailing slash follow a same pattern
4. By default firebase adds trailingSlash, set it to false in firebase hosting config.
```js
    {
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ],
    "trailingSlash": false
  }
}

```
