Answer
    In College, I liked studying Computer Vision, operating system, compilers.
    I like understanding Human interactions, How to say something, etc.
    In School, I liked studying History. I was able to read everything and was able to form mental connection.
    I was able to write answers which nobody else could think of.
    I am not able to replicate that level of understanding for anything else.
    If I can create a path that can be used by anyone to become better at some topics. 
    It will be cool.
    or atleast, I can learn it to gain my speed and efficiency of learning new topics.
    I was interested in solving the puzzles.



Hi Paul,

I want to do meaningful and high impact work in my life. 
My ideal thing would be comparable to like of Newton.

But, I really don't know. If I have the appetite or knowledge for it.
I am willing to learn and walk that path though.

How will you guide me in finding good fields to look into?

I have choosen some fields but I get disengaged from it after sometime.
There is a fear that, the field will become complex and I might not be able to understand it.
The path to completion seems too long.

Paul Answer
1. When dealing with a field that you feel is too big to tackle.
2. Start with the smallest bit of that field you can accomplish.
3. Don't worry about the whole path.
4. If you are not feeling like to work on the task, just get you brain started with the smallest task of reviewing etc.
