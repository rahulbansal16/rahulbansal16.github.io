The idea of working 10-12 hours is bullshit.
There was idea very popular few years ago.
It was if you are sleeping for 8 hours then you are losing those 8 hours.

Just like sleep for 4 hours promoted by the people.

If you have good clarity about the work you can do focused work for max like 6-8 hours.
But anything over that is one time thing and it can not be sustain.

I have done multiple hackathons which requires you to code for 24 hours.
The productivity goes downhill after not sleeping.
Even the working things starts breaking.

Let me quote Naval on it. He says work like a Lion not a cow.
Attack small chunks of tasks with focused mind for fixed time.
Do not keep doing the same things for whole day.


The idea of working 10-12 hours per day is urban legend.
Few years ago, it was popular that if you are sleeping 8 hours.
You are loosing 8 hours of your day. 

Today it's replaced by another one of working 10-12 hours.
The reality is human brain can not just work those many hours productively.

The research suggest that you can work for 4-5 hours with deep focus.
There is a period of your peak performance that you need to utilize.
And if you do it daily, You will be in top percentile.

The better approach to work is to work like lion not like a cow.
Cow grazes whole day while lion does the high intensity focus work for sometime.

so Who you know that works 12 hours a day?
