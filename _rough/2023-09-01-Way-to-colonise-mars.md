The hardest part of an Introvert is Putting themselves out.

For me Posting on Linkedin is Equivalent to Standing to an audience and speaking.

Psycologically commenting on a post is more like talking to someone next to you.

This whole linkedin is auditorium.

The waay brain interprets it All the linkedin profile as picture
So every time you are posting something the brain interprets it in the way
All the faces of people or memory associated with them flashes.

What can we learn from 
Introvert Guide to Posting.

What are the parallels it has to the conquiering moon.
