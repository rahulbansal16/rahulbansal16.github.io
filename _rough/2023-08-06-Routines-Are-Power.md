Let me transport you to prehistoric times.
You wake up in the morning,
Your biggest worry will be finding food.

You will keep roaming here and there
Looking for forages, nuts, meats etc.

Precious computing power of your brain will
be consumed by your brain

Fast Forward to today, What;s your bigguest question when you wake up
What to do for today.

If you are not sure about anything, you will do everything.
You will be slave but not of your mood but of everything.

What's the best way to do that, Have a plan about what to do for today.
Having Rough Plan will serve as your guide.

What's the best way to do that. 
The day before you wake up.
or the first thing in the morning.
