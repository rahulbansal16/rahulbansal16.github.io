Some of the Mistakes Non-Tech Founders make when looking for Tech Founder.

1. I want someone skilled in this tech stack.

Early stage products are all about building something that can be used to test hypothesis. 
Tech Founder should be able to build the MVP, iterate with little to no extra help. 
It's all about learning what is missing and building it. 
Looking for only particular tech stack you means are looking for rigid people.
who don't go and learn what's necessary.


2. I want someone who can scale and design systems.

It's similar to finding a founder with specific tech expertise.
Scaling isn't a big issue unless you're building something like Facebook, Instagram etc. 
The chances are higher that you are going to die even before you get 10 users. 

3. It just a small app, I will outsource it.

It's like not owning a car and depending upon uber. 
You will get uber most of the time, but you will struggle to get one during peak hours and emergency.
For startups there are always rush hours and emergency. 
No outsourcing will have that much intensity as of a tech founder.

4. I understand tech and can get some Founding Engineer. 

The tech space is evolving rapidly and most of the tech people also struggle to stay on top of the latest thing, so there is a very high chance that your knowledge is outdated. so don't underestimate tech contribution. You are more likely to succed focusing on business and getting a strong tech founder to build exceptional products.


5. I have already built the MVP.
The whole basis of software is the product evolves rapidly. 
That's why Bill Gates betted on Software instead of hardware.
IF you think, your product is already ready. 
You are either assuming that there will be no changes in features in the future.
Or you competition is not going to catch up with you. 
Which are highly unlikely.

Most of the Non-tech founders assume that they have very clear vision and path and now only things remaining is the building.
The reality is building and experimenting is what brings clarity. 
Every path and vision looks good in the mind, 
only when it gets to the code and real people it starts breaking.


1. Looking For Specific Tech Stack, Example I want someone who can code in react and typescript. A lot of early stage products are all about buliding something that can be used to test a hypothesis. Putting your co-founder tied to a particular tech stack is not a good idea. A Tech-founder should be able to build the MVP, iterate with little to no extra help. It's all about learning what is missing and building it. As a non-tech, do you keep yourself only for a particular role or you take what's required.

2. Looking specifically for someone who can scale, This is similar to looking for a founder with a specific tech stack. Scaling is not a big issue. If you are not building something like facebook, instagram. You should be fine in scaling using the existing infras and cloud solutions. The chances are higher that you are going to die even before you get 10 users.


3. I can just hire an engineer, Yes, that may work. It's like saying that I don't need to own a car, I can use uber / Ola to travel. You will get ola and uber most of the time but sometime you will struggle to get ola and uber during the peak hours and those moment you will think of owing a car. For the startups there are always the peak moments. No outsourced person will have that much intensity as the tech - founder.

4. I understand tech, I can get some Founding Engineer. This is a better approach atleast you know the tech, but the reality is tech space is evolving and most of the tech people also struggle to stay on top of the latest thing, so there is a very high chance that your knowledge about tech landscape is outdated. You can get a founding Engineer, but no founding engineer will be as motivated as the founder himself. Think about this, you can't just replace your mother's love of cooking for you with a hired cook. A tech co-founder is way more important than founding engineer. Unless you found an engineer that you are looking to make a co-founder.

5. I have already built the MVP, This is very 

What to look for in a tech-founder.

1. Builder, You want someone that can validate ideas quicker by building MVPs faster.
2. Determined, You need someone determined to build ideas and ship. Building something end to end is different. Only those who are determined can build.
3. Risk taker, Most of the engineers are risk averse thanks to the cushy job they have and shortage of tech talent. Look for one and once you find like that cherish them.
